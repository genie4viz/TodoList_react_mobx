mobx-react-boilerplate
=====================

A minimal application that combines [MobX](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx) with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).
Supports ES6 and JSX compilation through babel.

For a more sophisticated project to start with, see the full TodoMVC implementation: [mobx-react-todomvc](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-todomvc).

### Run the example

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
